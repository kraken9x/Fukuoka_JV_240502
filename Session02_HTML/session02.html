    <h3>1994–2012: Early life and career</h3>
    <p>
      Nguyễn Thanh Tùng was born on 5 July 1994 in Thái Bình, Thái Bình
      province, to parents Nguyễn Đức Thiện and Phạm Thị Thanh Bình.[2][3] Bình
      was a traditional dancer in the city's official performing group and a
      performer in Thái Bình's chèo theatre.[4][3] She met Thiện when he was
      working as a transport driver.[4] After becoming pregnant with Tùng, Bình
      opened a barbershop at home which later became a clothing store.[4][3] She
      also used to work as a bridal make-up artist.[5] The singer described his
      early life as "peaceful."[6] He has a younger brother, Nguyễn Việt Hoàng
      (b. 2000), who later starts his own music career in 2022 under the stage
      name Mono.<sub>[3][7][8][9]</sub>
    </p>
    <h3>2013–2015: Breakthrough and Dandelion</h3>
    <p>
      Tùng released three singles between August and December 2013: "Nắng ấm xa
      dần",[25] "Đừng về trễ"[26] and "Em của ngày hôm qua".[27] The latter
      launched Tùng's mainstream career and successfully gained over 100 million
      streams in three months on Zing MP3.[28][29][30] Favorite Song made it its
      Song of the Month in February 2014.[15] Tùng wrote "Gió cuốn em đi", which
      was performed and released by Quốc Thiên in April 2014.[31] The following
      month, Tùng contributed vocals to a charity cover of Tạ Quang Thắng's
      "Sống như những đóa hoa" and canceled a number of performances for surgery
      to remove a tumor from his leg.[32][33] In that June, it was announced
      that the singer would star in Dandelion, a semi-biographical film based on
      the life of late singer WanBi Tuấn Anh.[19] Quang Huy, founder and chief
      executive officer of WePro Entertainment, directed the film.[34][19]
      Dandelion was released in December 2014.[35] It grossed ₫60 billion
      (US$2.8 million) at the box office and became one of the most profitable
      Vietnamese films of all time.[36][37] Tùng's performance earned him a
      Golden Kite Prize, the Vietnamese equivalent of an Academy Award, for
      Young Prominent Actor.[38][39]
    </p>

      The singer embarked on his second nationwide concert tour, Sky Tour, from
      July to August 2019. The show was divided into two sets. The first half
      featured performances by guest acts such as Tiên Tiên, Rhymastic and
      Kimmese, while the other half was Tùng's solo set. Tickets to the Hồ Chí
      Minh and Hà Nội dates sold out. Despite many panning strict security
      measures at the concerts, critics still praised the performances and
      Tùng's audience interaction. The tour was chronicled in the documentary
      film, Sơn Tùng M-TP: Sky Tour Movie, which debuted in June 2020. Dubbed as
      Vietnam's first musical documentary, it grossed ₫5.5 billion (US$238.700)
      after the first three days of release even with mixed reviews.[104]
      Netflix went on to distribute the film globally.[105] An accompanying live
      album was also released.[106]
