    The <b>cat (Felis catus)</b>, commonly referred to as the
    <b> domestic cat </b>or <b>house cat</b>, is a small domesticated
    carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family
    Felidae. <i>Recent advances</i> in <u>archaeology</u> and genetics have
    shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around
    7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges
    freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for
    companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are
    adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible
    body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell
    are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
    crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing,
    purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body
    language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human
    ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives
    pheromones. Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn
    in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with
    litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred
    and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat
    fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and
    neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted
    in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of
    bird, mammal and reptile species. As of 2017, the domestic cat was the
    second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned
    and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United
    Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9
    million pet cats as of 2020.
